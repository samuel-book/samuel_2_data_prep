As we are using anonymised secondary data, collected for national audit, individual consent is not required. SSNAP has approval under section 251 of the NHS Health and Social Care Act (2006) to collect patient level data on the first six months of patient care (ECC 6- 02(FT3)/2012), without requiring individual patient consent. Access to SSNAP data is managed by the UK Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP), with this project being approved by HQIP (HQIP425). More information on SSNAPs use of patient data may be found at: https://www.strokeaudit.org/SupportFiles/Documents/Patient-area-documents/Fair-processing-statement-for-patients-v7-0.aspx
